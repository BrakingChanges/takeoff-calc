## TakeoffCalc

A very basic takeoff calculator, based on the the 737-800 AFM, taking into account assumed temperature, pressure altitude, temperature, flap setting(up to flaps 5)

### Features
- Performance figures up to flaps 5
- Assumed temperature calculation
- N1 setting for manual N1 use in the 737-800
- Stab Trim setting calculations based on CG and weight
- X-Plane integration with maximum climb N1 calculation

### Roadmap
Hopefully, in my free time, I might add an airport database and add runway length information for TODR, total TOR distance, clearway margins etc for a more realistic calculation for the 737-800
